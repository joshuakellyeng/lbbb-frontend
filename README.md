# Left Bank Burger Bar


This site was designed for a local restaurant as a landing page and an online menu.
#### Problem
Over the course of the pandemic one of my favorite restaurants, following state and government compliance removed physical menu's and instead opted to web based ones. The main problem with this was upon scanning the restaurant's menu was a PDF file hosted on the web. It was not responsive, dynamic and could not be updated.
#### Action
I decided I'd build them a new site with all the features of their current site and a menu that not only was almost identical to their original menu in style but could also be updated on the fly to display new menu items, delete old items and update current ones.
