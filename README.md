# Left Bank Burger Bar Web App




Built this web app for a local restaurant that I frequent. As one of my favorite places to eat I had a few issues with the site that I wished to fix.
The first was the menu. The menu on the site was a pdf file, not mobile friendly nor modifiable.
So I built an API for that would create a database for the site that can store contact messages menu items and applicants. The site allows you to create, update and delete items to the menu. Making it more dynamic, mobile friendly and easy to access for the end user. There is also a table for Contacts and Applicants to the company will be adding more features in the future.
